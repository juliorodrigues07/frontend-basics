# Front-end Basics
Repository for initial studies in Front-End, developing didactic mini-projects with basic raw technologies such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
 
 # Requirements
 
 - Package manager for Node.JS [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/):
 
       sudo apt-get install npm
 
 - To install all dependencies according to each project, run the following command inside the project directory:
 
       npm i
       
# Execution

- Again, inside the project directory, execute the following command:

      npm start

- You should receive an _URL_ as an output (`http://localhost:<port number>`). To visualize it, just open the _URL_ in a browser of your choice.

# Future Steps

- [ ] Improve code best practices and programming style;

- [ ] Rebuild the projects using Vue.js or React;

- [ ] Add new functionalities;

- [ ] Develop new and more complex projects.
